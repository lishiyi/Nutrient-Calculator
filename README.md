Modifications to [nick's](https://github.com/nick) [genetic soylent](https://github.com/nick/genetic-soylent) program for [diy.soylent.me](http://diy.soylent.me).

*   Addition of all nutrients
*   Rounds ingredients to whole values
*   Allows for ranking of nutrients
*   Allows import of recipe JSON from [diy.soylent.me](http://diy.soylent.me)
*   Added UI for max/min nutrient values and priority. UI still needs improvement.
